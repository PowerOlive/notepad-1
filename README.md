It's just a markdown editor, with no preview, lol.

## Want it on your own server?

Just click here:

[![Deploy it](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/huytd/notepad)

## Still not satisfied? Develop it!

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/huytd/notepad
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install

Then, just write some code and get back to the browser, you don't have to refresh, `webpack-dev-server` will do it for you.
